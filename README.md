# Number Guessing Game

## About Version 1.0

This project is inspired by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game) challenge. Also it's my first project on GitHub.

All project files are scripted on Python 3.13 in VSCode IDE. All main classes are stored in `./classes/`. The only `main.py` file allows to run the program. Not all classes and files are used for running a program (e. g. `database.py` - `Database`). This version of program doesn't support data savings but the space is prepared for further development and updates.

## How to Run

1. Import project files into your IDE:

```
git clone https://github.com/IliaSatrchevus/NumberGuessingGame.git

```

2. Execute `main.py` file and wait for a greeting.
3. Follow the instructions in CLI.

To quit the program finish the round and answer raising questions in CLI.
